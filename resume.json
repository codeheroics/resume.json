    "summary": "<p>Former expert web developer, I am in the midst of a major career change as I learn to create video games.</p> <p>My past career, spent working in technical environments, gives me the confidence that I’ll be able to evaluate the feasability and issues of projects during their design, and to be able to conceive, develop and test myself their prototypes.</p><p>I have made several games, which you’ll find on <a href='https://ffenril.itch.io'>ffenril.itch.io</a/. I work with both Unity and Unreal Engine.</p> <p>I have written many blog posts over the years, and written several short stories.</p> <p>This CV is an exhaustive list of my many professional experiences, but it does not reflect the creative turn I’ve now given my career, which is why I invite you to check my portfolio at <a href='https://codeheroics.com/en'>codeheroics.com/en</a>!</p>",
